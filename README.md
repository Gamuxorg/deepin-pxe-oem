PXE and OEM configuration of deepin, support amd64 and arm64.

The PXE and OEM file configuration examples used by the deepin Linux operating system can support x86_ 64 and aarch64 platforms, mips64el and loongarch64 cannot be supported temporarily (because efibootmgr cannot support these two platforms)
